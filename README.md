**RPCS3 Android Fork**

I'm a coding student working on an early-stage fork of the official RPCS3 Android port. Once I enough experience with Kotlin and C++. I plan to contribute to the official DHrpcs3 port.

**Note**: I'm not affiliated with the official RPCS3 team, and the base of the port is not my work.
